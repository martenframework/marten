_Under development._

## Bug fixes

* Fix a possible compilation error with custom settings namespace generation.
* Ensure that the [`serve`](../../development/reference/management-commands.md#serve) management command recompiles projects upon translation file changes.
* Fix the order of asset finders to ensure that those associated with configured asset directories (via the [`assets.dirs`](../../development/reference/settings.md#dirs) setting) have priority over those associated with application directories.
