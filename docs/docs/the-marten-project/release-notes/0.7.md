## New features

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* Query sets now provide a [`#limit`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#limit) method and an [`#offset`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#offset) method. Those methods respectively allow to limit the number of records returned and to offset the records returned. They act as aliases for the [`#[]` method with a range](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#range).
