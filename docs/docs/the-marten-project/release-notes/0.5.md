_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

* **Crystal:** 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11.
* **Databases:**
  * MariaDB 10.4 and higher.
  * MySQL 8.0.11 and higher.
  * PostgreSQL 12 and higher.
  * SQLite 3.27.0 and higher.

## New features

### Relations pre-fetching

Marten now provides the ability to prefetch relations when using [query sets](../../models-and-databases/queries.md) through the use of the new [`#prefetch`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#prefetch) method. When using [`#prefetch`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#prefetch), the records corresponding to the specified relationships will be prefetched in single batches and each record returned by the original query set will have the corresponding related objects already selected and populated.

For example:

```crystal
posts_1 = Post.all.to_a
# hits the database to retrieve the related "tags" (many-to-many relation)
puts posts_1[0].tags.to_a

posts_2 = Post.all.prefetch(:tags).to_a
# doesn't hit the database since the related "tags" relation was already prefetched
puts posts_2[0].tags.to_a
```

Like the existing [`#join`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#join) method, this allows to alleviate N+1 issues commonly encountered when accessing related objects. However, unlike [`#join`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#join) (which can only be used with single-valued relationships), [`#prefetch`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#prefetch) can be used with both single-valued relationships and multi-valued relationships (such as [many-to-many](../../models-and-databases/relationships.md#many-to-many-relationships) relationships, [reverse many-to-many](../../models-and-databases/relationships.md#backward-relations-2) relationships, and [reverse many-to-one](../../models-and-databases/relationships.md#backward-relations) relationships).

Please refer to [Pre-fetching relations](../../models-and-databases/queries.md#pre-fetching-relations) to learn more about this new capability.

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* A new [`#pks`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#pks) method was introduced for query sets to make it easy to retrieve the primary key values of the model records targeted by a given current query set.
* A [`#count`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Model/Querying/ClassMethods.html#count(field%3AString|Symbol|Nil%3Dnil)-instance-method) method is now available on model classes and provides the same functionality as the [`#count`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#count) query set method.
* A new [`#bulk_create`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#bulk_create) method was introduced to make it easy to insert multiple model instances into the database in a single query (which can be useful when dealing with large amounts of data that need to be inserted into the database).
* A new [`#average`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#average) method was introduced to allow computing the average values of a specific model field at the database level for the records targeted by a specific query set.
* A new [`#sum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#sum) method was introduced to allow computing the sum of the values of a specific model field at the database level for the records targeted by a specific query set.
* It is now possible to compute the minimum and maximum values of a specific field at the database level for the records targeted by a query set through the use of the [`#minimum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#minimum) and [`#maximum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#maximum) methods.
* The [`in`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#in) query set predicate now supports filtering on arrays of model records directly.

#### Handlers and HTTP

* The [`#render`](../../handlers-and-http/introduction.md#render) helper method and the generic handlers that involve template renderings now automatically insert the request object in the template context.
* The [`Marten::Handlers::RecordDetail`](../../handlers-and-http/reference/generic-handlers.md#displaying-a-record), [`Marten::Handlers::RecordUpdate`](../../handlers-and-http/reference/generic-handlers.md#updating-a-record), and [`Marten::Handlers::RecordDelete`](../../handlers-and-http/reference/generic-handlers.md#deleting-a-record) generic handlers now provide the ability to specify a custom [query set](../../models-and-databases/queries.md) instead of a model class. This can be achieved through the use of the [`#queryset`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/RecordRetrieving.html#queryset(queryset)-macro) macro.

#### Templates

* Enum values can now be used in templates. Please refer to [Using enums in contexts](../../templates/introduction.md#using-enums-in-contexts) to learn more about this capability.
* Support for the `nil`, `true`, and `false` literals was added to the Marten templating language. Please refer to [Literal values](../../templates/introduction.md#literal-values) for more details on supported literals.
* The [`assign`](../../templates/reference/tags.md#assign) template tag now supports an `unless assigned` suffix which allows to specify that the assignment must happen only if no variable with the same name is already present in the template context.

#### Development

* The [`collectassets`](../../development/reference/management-commands.md#collectassets) management command now provides the ability to fingerprint collected assets and generate a corresponding JSON manifest. Please refer to [Asset manifests and fingerprinting](../../assets/introduction.md#asset-manifests-and-fingerprinting) to learn more about this capability.

#### Security

* It is now possible to configure that the [CSRF](../../security/csrf.md) token must be persisted in the session store. This can be achieved by setting the [`use_session`](../../development/reference/settings.md#use_session) setting to `true`.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Handlers making use of the [`Marten::Handlers::Schema`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Schema.html) generic handler (or schemas inheriting from it, such as [`Marten::Handlers::RecordCreate`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/RecordCreate.html) or [`Marten::Handlers::RecordUpdate`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/RecordUpdate.html)) will now return a **422 Unprocessable Content** response instead of a **200 OK** response when processing an invalid schema. While this won't have any incidence on end users, this change may make some specs fail if you were testing the response code of handlers that process invalid schema data. The way to fix this will be to replace `200` by `422` in the impacted specs.
